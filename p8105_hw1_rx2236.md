This dataset has 358 rows and 15 variables/columns. The variables are
origin, year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed,
wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib, time_hour.

The `origin` variable is where the weather station locates. In this
dataset, the only value for this variable is EWR.

The `year`, `month`, `day` and `hour` variables are time of recording.
In this dataset, the only value of `year` is 2013 and the only value of
`month` is 1. Value of `day` ranges from 1, 15 and value of `hour`

The `temp` and `dewp` represent temperature and dewpoint in F. The
average temperature is 39.5821229 F and temperature ranges from 24.08,
57.92 F.

The `humid` variable represents the relative humidity which has an
average value 65.4767039. The `wind_dir`, `wind_speed` and `wind_gust`
represent wind direction (in degrees), speed and gust speed (in mph).

The `precip` represents the precipitation (in inches), `pressure`
represents sea level pressure in millibars, and `visib` represents
visibility (in miles).

Finally, the `time_hour` is the date and hour of the recording as a
POSIXct date.
