## Problem 1

### Data description

This dataset has 358 rows and 15 variables/columns. The variables are
origin, year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed,
wind_gust, precip, pressure, visib, time_hour.

The `origin` variable is where the weather station locates. In this
dataset, the only value for this variable is EWR.

The `year`, `month`, `day` and `hour` variables are time of recording.
In this dataset, the only value of `year` is 2013 and the only value of
`month` is 1. Value of `day` ranges from 1, 15 and value of `hour`
ranges from 0, 23.

So this dataset shows weather information of EWR airport in the first 15
days of January in 2013.

The `temp` and `dewp` represent temperature and dewpoint in F. The
average temperature is 39.5821229 F and temperature ranges from 24.08,
57.92 F.

The `humid` variable represents the relative humidity which has an
average value 65.4767039. The `wind_dir`, `wind_speed` and `wind_gust`
represent wind direction (in degrees), speed and gust speed (in mph).

The `precip` represents the precipitation (in inches), `pressure`
represents sea level pressure in millibars, and `visib` represents
visibility (in miles).

Finally, the `time_hour` is the date and hour of the recording as a
POSIXct date.

### Making plot

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
```

Apparent patterns in this plot include temperature fluctuates
periodically, with a increasing tendency. When temperature rises, the
humidity usually rises, and when temperature drops, the humidity drops
as well in the overall picture. Generally the humidity is higher in the
second half of the recorded time period.

## Problem 2

### Create dataframe

``` r
p2_df = 
  tibble(
    num_samp = rnorm(10),
    log_vec = num_samp > 0,
    cha_vec = c('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j'),
    factor_vec = factor(rep_len(c(1, 2, 3), 10))
  )
```

### Take means

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, num_samp))
```

    ## [1] -0.6002166

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, log_vec))
```

    ## [1] 0.2

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, cha_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(p2_df, cha_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(p2_df, factor_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(p2_df, factor_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA
